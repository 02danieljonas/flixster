### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The  topics did help in completing the lab and at no time did I look at a lab and felt unprepared.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would try to make my clone a lot like Netflix, including carousel, modals and trailers acting as the content.
  
* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

For this project what didn't go as plan was recreating Netflix. I overscopped and thought I could complete all of Netflix's features in 2-3 days. I wish I didn't take the netflix route and just made the best program that I could. I have learned that I should minimalize my scope when programing and add more features as I finish.

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

### Shout out

I would like to give a shoutout to my teammate Shehab Mohsen, his company during friday helped me with the stress I was feeling trying to recreate Netflix.
